# SQLAlchemy Restaurant Reviews

This repository contains a simple implementation of a restaurant review system using SQLAlchemy. The code defines three classes: Restaurant, Customer, and Review. It allows you to create and manage restaurants, customers, and reviews, as well as perform various operations related to them.

# Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed, and install the required packages using:


pip install sqlalchemy
# Usage

- Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/restaurant-reviews.git
cd restaurant-reviews
 
- Run the script:

python restaurant_reviews.py
The script demonstrates the usage of the implemented classes with sample data. It creates an SQLite database in memory, adds restaurants, customers, and reviews, and performs various queries and operations.
